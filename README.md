### Spec
The project's objective is to list trending projects from GitHub, allow users to tap on one of them, and display their details. You are free to choose the appearance of the app, but adhering to Android's Material Design guidelines is highly encouraged. The better the app looks, the better!

#### Requirements Language
Write your application in Kotlin. 

#### Compatibility
Ensure your application is compatible with the latest version of Android. The layout of the screens must work on all supported Android 14 (API Level 34) devices. 

#### Architecture
Use good architecture and design patterns, adhering to SOLID principles. 

#### UI Framework
Use Jetpack Compose for the UI. Incorporating some animations is a big plus. 

#### Simplicity
The project needs to work just by running it - Keep it simple :) Theming: Make sure the app works both in dark and light mode with the ability to change it within the app. 

#### Additional Notes
If there is something not specified, please feel free to make your own decisions. Let us know if you need anything or have any questions about the project.
